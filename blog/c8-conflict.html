          <p>I'm not comfortable at all with the prompt this week and I don't think this assignment belongs on anyone's professional portfolio site. Thie question about conflict is perfectly appropriate question for a private job interview, but asking people to choose something that's not "the most intense emotional conflict [but] one you feel OK sharing with others" means that you're not going to get any kind of real reflective response. I know the blog is not the place for "feedback" but I feel I have to set this up appropriately.

          I'm happy to talk about conflict and how as a professional I've learned to handle it better over the years, but I will not discuss a specific instance of interpersonal conflict. As someone who has put a lot of hard work into overcoming avoiding conflict, I also take extreme issue with "conflict" and "shame" being bound together in this prompt.

          I used to try to avoid conflict under all circumstances when I was younger, in both my personal and professional relationships. This didn't work out very well because as hard as I would try to please people and avoid rocking the boat, I still couldn't help but find myself in conflict over any number of things, trivial and not so trivial. I think it's important to think of conflict of something that is natural, and intrinsically attaching it to shame as this prompt does not only mischaracterizes the many nuances of conflict, but it's legitimately harmful to conflate the two. Dealing with shame and dealing with conflict are two entirely different things; sometimes they may be related, but if you find yourself in a situation where you are in conflict, you need to be able to recognize first when it is appropriate to engage or disengage.

          Immediately thinking of being in conflict as something that is shameful can cause people to disengage or surrender when they are perfectly justified in defending their position (and defending themselves). People need to be equipped with the right tools to handle conflict effectively so that they can deeply understand their position, and negotiate from a sincere place of good faith, both for themselves and the person with whom they are in conflict.

          The Compass of Shame, while it has some value in a potentially different prompt (and with a different resource to explain it, which I won't get into here) is not a good tool for helping someone learn how to deal with conflict. It is entirely disempowering and assumes that someone is in conflict because they have done something shameful. People will encounter conflict no matter what they do in their lives and they need to be prepared to deal with it regardless; this just reinforces that conflict is bad and will have the unintended consequence of making things worse for people who already avoid it and aren't strong advocates for themselves.
