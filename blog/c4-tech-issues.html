          <p>I follow the tech industry pretty closely, so over the past couple years I've been actively working to try to keep myself from being too cynical since the issues facing the industry are so many. Fortunately, because there are so many people who maintain their idealism within the industry, it means that there is a fantastic amount of really smart criticism coming from people who are both very informed about the industry and remain convinced it can do better.

          Earlier today I was reading an article about <a href="http://www.salon.com/2014/11/02/the_sharing_economy_has_a_race_problem/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">racial issues in the "sharing economy"</a> in which the author pointed out that "it’s worth remembering that bias in the sharing economy is a new version of an old problem." This is true for many of the cultural issues that crop up in tech -- in how products are designed and who they are designed for (issues affecting users), as well as how they're built (issues affecting the tech workplace). None of the misogyny going on in Gamergate is strictly a product of Gamergate, just as the implicit racial bias discussed in the Salon article is not exclusive to apps based on the sharing economy, just as tech is (of course) not wholly responsible for the market forces that focus product development attention and resources on problems that stem from the privilege of not having to deal with more pressing issues — see this brilliant/painful <a href= "http://nymag.com/news/features/laundry-apps-2014-5/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">NY Magazine piece on the race to disrupt laundry</a> as an example.

          There are no shortage of industries who have these same issues, but when you sell your industry as "new" and "innovative" and "disruptive" you set yourself up to be held to a higher standard. I'm grateful to all of the critical voices in tech (like at <a href="https://modelviewculture.com/" target= "_blank" rel="nofollow">Model View Culture</a> and others) who look not just at specific issues, but see them as intersectional, understanding that each piece contributes to supporting and upholding others.

          It would be an understatement to say that the tech sector has had massive impacts on shaping our world and culture; for any endeavor to which we contribute time or money (either as workers or as users), it's important to ask ourselves whether it's disruptive in a way that generally benefits society, or if it's just a new, innovative way to reinforce existing biases and power structures. This isn't easy, but it's certainly something I'm trying to be more mindful of. As the Salon article implies, if we can innovate all of these new business models, certainly we can save some of that innovation for thinking through the human and cultural impact of the product itself.
