          <p>A couple weeks ago, I ended up in a GPS session with only a guide and no partner. I shared my frustration with getting so little feedback from my first GPS guide because it meant I didn't know whether I was doing a good job in the role that I'd had (at that point, navigator). He told me something that I think has really benefited me in future pairing sessions, but that I wish more students were in on: that the more you pair, the more fluid it becomes and the more roles break down.

          I feel like this is really important because I've seen in some of my feedback that other students express surprise (in a positive way) that our sessions have been so fluid, including talking about how helpful it is for us both to be researching and running rspec and testing things out. This approach has been so helpful to me, especially at this stage in our learning where we're still all trying to learn what things do and it concerns me that we <em>start out</em> with thinking we have to be in very prescriptive roles when I'm hearing from other students echoes of my own need to experiment and watch things break.

          I think it could be very different when you're working side by side with someone, but pairing remote like this lends those roles even more stratification. My most successful pairs so far have definitely been those in which we either switched off, worked on different parts of the same problem (much easier now that we're getting into breaking things down more and writing test code), or each shared both code and research back and forth with one another while sharing our screens at the same time.

          I'll be interested to see once we get onsite how pairing works and how instructor feedback is given; each of my guided sessions has been so completely different from one another that I still have no understanding of whether I'm driving or navigating the <em>right</em> way. So if it's true what my solo guide said and we all do eventually learn that there is no one right way, I think it will ease anxiety for a lot of people. I love collaboration, but I also love identifying and playing to peoples' strengths, and you can only do that once you start working with someone and figuring out where they're at rather than starting off with a predefined role for each of you.
