          <p>Choosing a small number of values from that list was pretty difficult; I tend to believe strongly in a lot of things, and many of them may appear to conflict each other &em; for instance, I value complexity and creativity as well as efficiency and order. Community and autonomy also go hand-in-hand for me; I think it's important to allow individuals to be themselves and pursue their own interests while they are being mindful and supportive of those around them in achieving their own aims. Basically, these can all be separated either into (sometimes ridiculously) high standards I have for myself and things that I appreciate in others and judge them by only in relationship to how they treat others.

          Added: Feminism, Art, Complexity, Chosen Family (vs. Having a Family), Listening, Reserving Judgment, Diversity, Secularism. I also changed "Intellectual status" to "intelligence" because those are very different things; anything appended with "status" is arbitrary and has little to do with the actual contributions or worth of a person.

          I try to live up to these, but it's certainly a lot. I'm better at living up to the external ones than the internal ones (focusing on anything having to do with "self" or "personal" is a relatively new thing for me.)

          I often get asked for advice in my role as a consultant, so while I'd like to try to stay away from anything professional here and focus more on personal advice, it's hard because most of my friends and acquaintances are professionals who talk about business for fun and because we appreciate each other's perspectives. In the past week, I've been helping a friend asses potential homes to buy, gotten requests from multiple organizations to help advise on data/cataloging strategies (and a third to help advise on digital privacy), and have been giving my partner help with positioning for a product he's working on.

          I feel like I'm missing something in this prompt, because it never identifies what "affirmation" is in the context of stereotype threat or how it's supposed to have anything to do with your values. I found this resource that discusses <a href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/reduce.html#encouragingself" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">values as they relate to affirmation</a> and while it doesn't say specifically why they think the affirming of values helped, I'd imagine it has something to do with individuation and allowing the students to reinforce both their capabilities as well as what makes them "unique" and therefore not as subject to the pressure of reinforcing larger cultural stereotypes. I personally have a hard time with using my values to combat my own personal feelings of stereotype threat, mostly because they put pressure on me in other ways, but the advice aspect is potentially helpful.
