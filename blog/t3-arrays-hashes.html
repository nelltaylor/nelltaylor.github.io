        <span>Phase 0 Week 3 Technical Blog: Arrays Vs. Hashes</span> <span1>By: <strong>Nell Taylor</strong>  |  10-26-14</span1>

          <p>The core difference between <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.0/Array.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">arrays</a> and <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.3/Hash.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">hashes</a> are that arrays are ordered lists that correspond to unique integers you can use to reference them within that list, and hashes are lists of keys and their values or attributes with no other order than that in which you enter them. A hash can be called an "associative array" because it allows you to list objects (like an array does) but associates values with them. What gets complicated about calling a hash an associative array is that may confuse you into thinking that hashes retain other characteristics of arrays (such as order) that they don't actually possess.

          Creating an array might look something like this:

          <code><code_id>lonely_num</code_id> <code_span>= [<code_num>1</code_num>, <code_num>1.0</code_num>, 'one', 'uno']</code_span></code>

          While a hash would show key-value pairs like this:

          <code><code_id>numbers</code_id> <code_span> = { "lonely" => <code_num>1</code_num>, "company" => <code_num>2</code_num>, "crowd" => <code_num>3</code_num>, "people in 2 sets of horse costumes" => <code_num>4</code_num>}</code_span></code>

          Notice that an array can have different kinds of elements in it at the same time. In this example, it has integers, floats, and strings. Arrays can also store other arrays to create multi-dimensional rays. They can even store hashes. But hashes will only store key-value pairs.

          Both of these classes are used to store data about sets of objects, and both have many different methods you can call on those sets in order to get information out of them; arrays, however, have many more methods than hashes do. Be careful, because these methods often share the same names, but have different effects depending on whether you're using them on hashes or arrays.

          Hashes are great for simple, short-term storage of data and some developers find them quick and easy substitute for creating custom classes when you only need to store one value for each object keyed into your hash. Where arrays become useful is for large datasets, or datasets where you need to store and access more than one value for objects within your array. That's when you have "arrays of arrays" which can be thought of like tables &mdsh; this is where the importance of the elements within arrays being indexed by unique integers really begins to make sense: those unique integers in combination allow you to reference the exact location within the array of the value you're seeking, and allow you to easily navigate the data within the array by going an integer up or down, and so on. If all you need is a two-column table with a key in the first column and a value in the second, the hash will do just fine, though you'll find key-value pairs within arrays, as well.
