Healthy Relationships with Work & Anticipating Hurdles

10-12-14

I had a good feeling going into Dev Bootcamp that the folks who run it and teach it have spent a lot of time thinking about what makes someone successful in the field rather than what makes someone a "good programmer." I've been pleasantly surprised the deeper I go in the suggested reading and all of these videos that this isn't just a philosophy that gets brought up in admissions, but runs throughout the program. Hearing it reinforced in the Fireside Chat is even more reassuring, especially because of the questions from other students and the real life examples that are brought up about how other people bring these things into their professional practice.

I also very much apppreciate all of the various resources Dev Bootcamp has provided so far, and how wide ranging they are. They do a fantastic job of setting you up to teach yourself and providing tools to knock down certain assumptions about things that people might think can't be taught, like being an autodidact. From the materials on mindset to time management to some of the other early resources (thank you for introducing me to "A Mind For Numbers" â€” I grew up being told it was okay that I wasn't good at math because I was good at art and writing instead of being helped to learn, so I'm really looking forward to reading this), I'm really impressed at how much Dev Bootcamp seems to anticipate the real or imagined hurdles students set up for themselves.

I'm really looking forward to participating in the process and seeing the impact students with Dev Bootcamp's particular flavor of culture make on the technology world. Vulnerable, collaborative, acknowledging impostor syndrome, and being encouraged not to work til 2am are all things that are refreshing to hear.
