        <span>Phase 0 Week 6 Culture Blog: Stereotype Threat</span> <span1>By: <strong>Nell Taylor</strong>  |  11-14-14</span1>

          <p>I was really happy to open up this week's culture blog assignment and find out that stereotype threat and imposter syndrome were the topics. Stereotype threat in particular is a great one to focus on because it's harder to understand it than imposter syndrome &em; even though I first read about it a couple years ago, the refresher I took on it this week illuminated all kinds of things for me that I didn't pick up the first time around. Probably because I was reading an article about a study rather than hearing the full context from Dr. Claude Steele himself.

          The context for this is really important because without confronting and respecting the ways that each of us individually experience our own identities, it's impossible to open yourself up to the idea that those identities can affect how you perceive yourself and your talents in relation to others. Stereotype threat is just one of the ways that our identities subconsciously shape how we make our way through the world, but it's an important one because it hinges so much of our interior world on stereotypes set not only externally, but well outside of our communities.

          xkcd perhaps illustrated the underlying factor best, as he does: "<a href="http://xkcd.com/385/" target = "_blank" rel="nofollow">How It Works</a>"

          What happens when an individual is experiencing stereotype threat is that they have compounding pressure on their performance because they are not just bearing their own weight, but that of those who share their identity. Poor performance could confirm a stereotype about an identity of theirs, and therefore they struggle even more in difficult and frustrating situations where they want to excel. Dr. Steele and his colleagues have shown that this has a quantifiable impact in all sorts of situations, from test taking to social interaction.

          The latter is where I have usually noticed that I've experienced it in the past, particularly at conferences where I'm one of the few women. I find myself shutting down rather than participate and risk confirming bias that women don't belong there. It's harder to correct than it seems, even when you recognize it in yourself. One of the solutions Dr. Steele mentioned was a specific way to offer criticism and encouragement, and I immediately recognized that strategy as a way that a college professor and more recently a colleague of mine convinced me to push myself into uncomfortable, more ambitious territory simply by telling me that they knew that I could. This is something I'll definitely be thinking about to help out people I may encounter in a similar situation (as well as always being critical of the spaces I create and operate in to help ensure they are safe and welcoming), but it's much harder to overcome it (for me at least) without external validation. Something to work on for sure.
