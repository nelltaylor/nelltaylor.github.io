          <p>For the thinking styles, I scored high on both the "abstract" styles and only a little lower than those two on "Concrete Random," with "Concrete Sequential" barely in the picture. This makes a lot of sense to me because I recognize things that work best for me and things that are hard for me in both of those lists, but they change to somewhat surprisingly large degrees based on context.

          My "Concrete Random" side likes the trial and error aspect of what we've learned so far because I love solving problems and researching and fighting to find solutions, but that side of me is often frustrated by my "Abstract Sequential" side which gets stressed out without enough time to truly analyze, find all different angles to a problem, and seek out references before experimenting. I was surprised to find myself in a number of pairs where my partner would say "Well let's just try this code out to see what happens" when we both knew it wouldn't work; my knee-jerk internal response was that the results of those kinds of trials were useless because we hadn't put in enough thought to ensure we got an actionable error, but the approach ended up actually making sense and I found myself altering my style to be looser with what I ran through RSPEC vs. chasing down my fully wrapped idea of what the program should be, then running it. There are good points and bad to being analytics/perfectionist/hard on myself to the point that I want things to fail with a purpose, even if I'm willing to accept that they will fail.

          I'm reading A Mind for Numbers right now along with Phase 0 because I let myself be convinced when I was younger that I simply wasn't good at math and that was okay because people were either good at literature and arts or math and science. And neither of those kinds of people were good at sports. Though I know all that to be ridiculous now, it certainly set my learning back years, and allowed me to get out of having to take any math in college at all because my art school accepted my score of 3 on the AP Statistics test as credit. So I'm playing catch up now not only in learning, but also in working to rewire my brain to be able to process all of this. At least now I'm convinced that I can learn and adapt; as frustrating as some aspects of Ruby have been so far, I have a lot of confidence I can get there.
