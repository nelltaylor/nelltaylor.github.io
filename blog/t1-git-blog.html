          <p>Version control is massively beneficial for developers who have a lot of detail to keep track of across many dependent files. Small changes or bugs in one file can create massive errors across a system, so it's important to be able to quickly identify and roll back changes to get everything running smoothly while the bug is fixed. It's also very useful for testing and deploying new features that can be rolled back if they're not widely adopted, or if they simply need more iteration. Developers who are collaborating will find version control particularly useful as it allows them all of the above benefits personally while also ensuring they don't overwrite each others' work and making sure that everyone collaborating has access to the most up-to-date versions of code.

          Git is a widely used toolset to track changes. Git commands allow you to have a systematic and orderly approach to working on files, staging them, and committing the changes so that you have built in check-ins along the way — from pulling from your remote repository to make sure everything you have is up to date, to pushing your own commits to files you've edited and adding comments to let others know what changes you've made.

          Git lives on your local machine, as opposed to GitHub which is a social "hub" that replicates the Git architecture of your local repositories so that you can share code with distributed collaborators privately or publicly, or simply share it with the world if you want to make a program, code snippet, or library available to everyone.</p>
