          <p>NoSQL databases sound like they may be in direct opposition to SQL databases, but in fact, it's closer to think of the "N" and "O" as standing for "Not" and "Only." While a NoSQL database may still sometimes be queried like a SQL database (hence Not Only SQL), the big difference is in relational vs. non-relational distributed databases.

          A relational database like SQL uses a table structure to store and access data, while a NoSQL database can take many different forms. The ones I was familiar with prior to my research were all based on Document models (CouchDB, Couchbase, Solr, and MongoDB), so it was interesting to see how many other categories are out there, including graph (which I will need to get more familiar with since I'm currently working for a big data startup), key-value stores (which has a dozen of its own subcategories), columnar, tabular, object-based, and more.

          The benefits of a NoSQL database vary depending on the database type and the application for which you're using it, but these kinds of databases are often chosen over SQL databases for their scalability, flexibility and performance under pressure of handling ever increasing volumes of data. MongoDB has an excellent, clear summary of the <a href="http://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">benefits of NoSQL databases</a> (not just Mongo) that gets into deeper detail and also explains how NoSQL databases manage to handle both structured and unstructured data dynamically. This is a huge advantage over relational databases in which you need to define your schema in advance.
