          <p>There's a misconception about consulting that most of a consultant's job involves providing answers. While solutions are the broad deliverable and I am providing them in response to client's questions, I would never come close to the right solution without asking hours of questions. That's why when I scope a project, the Discovery phase is often twice as long as the process of actually putting together recommendations; the "problem" I need to solve is often not what has been identified to me as the problem, but trying to figure out what the real problem is.

          This background has been very helpful for me throughout my time at DBC so far, since it's helped me to be mindful of the possibility that what I think is the problem may actually be something else entirely. Reading the resources and their emphasis on the importance of clarity, concision, and specificity are all great, but the detail of including "what you are trying to do" is such a huge part of asking a good question.

          If you leave yourself open to the possibility that the code (or any tool) you are using to try to solve a problem may actually just not be suited for the job, you wind up saving yourself so much trouble in the long run. So far I've found my questions hinging much more around whether my approach is the right one, than why I can't get something to work that I'm certain should work and I've found that questions that result in dialogue and discussion among the askers and answerers to be most helpful for me to observe. Breaking people of defesiveness around a solution early and helping them be able to able to ask the kind of questions that can both elicit specific help OR a redirection if their assumptions were off-base are all extremely important; if you're too in love with the solution you're asking about to accept that it may be entirely wrong instead of partially wrong, it will be difficult to get the bigger picture and learn.

          The resources also did a good job of setting up the need to make yourself available to have the people who would help you ask follow up questions, exactly for these reasons. The idea of asking "the perfect question" only very infrequently ends with just one question.
